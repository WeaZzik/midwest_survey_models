# midwest_survey_models

A couple of quick models designed for the dataset midwest survey.

# How to

- Fork this repository.
- Clone it locally.
- Run `pixi install` to create a clean virtual environment.
- Run `pixi run convert-to-notebooks` if you prefer to work with notebooks rather than python files. 
- If you have too much trouble with pixi, you can use your usual virtual env system, and use the requirements.txt.
- Answer the questions below based on your exploration.
- Run `pixi run convert-to-python-files` if you worked in notebooks.
- Push your code and your answers to your fork.

# Steps of the tutorial

1. Look for a file called "security_breach.txt" in your computer. How was it created?

Created by the execution of the transformer file and joblib loading

2. This file created is quite harmless; could you give an example of something that could have been done more harmful?

Any persistent mechanism or malware download from an external source could've been more harmful... since joblib can execute arbitrary code

3. Implement a new way to safely share models (hint: check the library skops) :

```
import skops.io as sio

sio.dump(model_lr, "model_logistic_regression.skops")
unknown_types = sio.get_untrusted_types(file="model_logistic_regression.skops")

model_lr_safe = sio.load(
    "model_logistic_regression.skops",
    trusted=unknown_types
)
```

# ANSWERS

My answers are in the notebooks files, directly in the comments
